# Gem Jewelry Photography Playbook 2025

Short kit, sharp images. This is the bench-ready, phone-first method I use to make stones look like they do in my hand—alive.

**Abstract.** The market doesn’t buy “almost.” Your photos must show true color, real fire, clean geometry, and honest surface. With a phone, a tripod, a few lights, and smart diffusion/reflectors, you can get there—fast, repeatable, and sale-ready.

<details><summary><b>TL;DR</b></summary>

- Phone + tripod + geared head = stability and micro-angles.  
- Daylight (~5500K) only; don’t mix color temps.  
- Diffuse to control glare; add a mirror/foil kick for crisp life.  
- Single hard point for stars/eyes; wide beam for opal; experiment for adularescence/labradorescence.  
- Square the stone, center culet/keel, then “paint with light.”  
- If it looks wrong: fix light first, not the stone.

## Overview

Most listings undersell the piece. The fix isn’t a $5,000 rig; it’s discipline: neutral light, controlled reflections, and a workflow that treats light like a tool, not a mystery. This playbook keeps the kit lean and the decisions simple so you can shoot fast, consistent, and truthful.

## Key Insights

### Minimal Kit, Maximum Control
- **Phone with a good camera.** Pro mode helps, but the important part is stability and light.
- **Tripod + geared head.** Lock the frame; nudge angle by fractions to wake up light return.
- **Lights.** One LED ring for even base; two or three bright floods for punch and depth-of-field.
- **Diffusers.** Printer paper, milk-jug plastic, or a cone. Soft light = controlled speculars.
- **Reflectors.** White card (soft fill), small mirror/foil (crisp highlight). DIY poster board: white on one side, foil on the other.
- **Phone backer card.** White cardstock taped behind the phone (hole for lens) to prevent the phone’s body from reflecting into the stone and to add soft fill.

### Light & Color Discipline
- **Daylight only.** Aim ~5500K. Mixing 2800K and 4000K with daylight creates ugly color math your phone won’t fix.
- **Watch the screen while you move lights.** The screen is your live histogram of “does this stone look right?”
- **Backlight with caution.** It can over-emphasize internals. Use a folded white card behind the gem to block direct backlight while keeping the background bright and clean.
- **Depth-of-field is paid for with photons.** More light → smaller effective aperture → more gem in focus.

### Diffusion & Reflectors
- **Diffuse to kill blowouts.** Harsh white patches erase facet detail. Put diffusion *between* light and stone, 12–24 inches from the subject.
- **Trade-off:** diffusion smooths body color but can reduce dispersion. For diamonds/demantoid, ease off the diffusion or introduce a small hard kick to chase rainbow fire.
- **Reflectors are steering wheels.** White card for gentle fill; mirror/foil for a pinpoint catchlight that makes a crown come alive.

### Backgrounds & Surfaces
- **Keep the stage neutral.** Gray/white/black beats decorative chaos. The gem is the headline.
- **Use that phone backer.** It blocks unwanted reflections and adds fill.
- **Avoid color casts.** Colored props = color pollution. If the stone looks “off,” the background probably talks too loud.

### Phenomena Strategies
- **General rule:** First, rock the stone in your hand under good light to find the angle where the magic happens. Then recreate that angle on the tripod.

**Fire/Dispersion (diamond, demantoid).**  
Use reflected light. Bring in a small mirror/foil kicker from different angles; watch for spectral flashes to pop. Reduce diffusion to let hard reflections break into color.

**Asterism (stars) & Chatoyancy (cat’s-eyes).**  
One, single, hard point. Everything else off. If the star is “fat,” narrow the beam with a DIY snoot (tube). Keep stone fixed; move the light until the star/eye centers.

**Play-of-Color (opal).**  
Wide beam. Window daylight or an undiffused strobe/LED panel works. Keep the stone still; move the light in arcs. Ethiopian material often rewards direct light; be patient.

**Adularescence (moonstone) & Labradorescence (labradorite).**  
Start diffused, then test direct. The glow often lives on a plane—when the light strikes the right angle, it blooms. Map that angle, then lock it.

## Dealer Playbook

**Positioning the shot**
- Square the table to the lens; center the culet/keel. This is your default because it maximizes intended symmetry and light return.
- Once framed, move light—not the stone. Small light changes beat big stone moves.

**Lighting sequence (base SOP)**
1. Kill mixed lights in the room; run only your chosen daylight sources.  
2. Set the LED ring for even base.  
3. Add one flood at 45° for structure; check screen.  
4. Add diffusion to tame hot spots.  
5. Introduce a mirror/foil kicker to ignite a catchlight.  
6. For dispersion, relax diffusion or tilt the kicker.  
7. For phenomena, switch to the relevant scheme (single hard point / wide beam).

**Color honesty**
- If color looks wrong, blame light before lens. Check color temps, then re-white-balance.
- Avoid post “fix it in editing” beyond minor exposure/contrast. Trustworthy color sells itself.

**Speed & repeatability**
- Build a small repeatable set: marked tripod positions, labeled light stands, a bin of pre-cut diffusers and cards. Minutes matter on busy days.

**When to shoot video**
- Short, stable clips help for phenomena and scintillation. Same light rules apply. Keep movements slow; let the stone do the dancing.

## Red Flags & Fast Tests

- **“Foggy” crown / blown facets:** You’re undiffused and too close. Add diffusion; step lights back; reduce intensity.
- **Muted sparkle in close-ups:** You starved the front of the stone. Add a forward kicker; adjust angles by millimeters.
- **Weird color:** You mixed color temps or picked the wrong Kelvin. Go full daylight; re-balance.
- **Double stars / smeared cat’s-eye:** Too many lights. Kill everything except one hard point; snoot if needed.
- **Background bleeding into the stone:** Colored prop or phone body reflection. Use neutral surfaces and a white phone backer.

## FAQs

**Q: Do I need a macro lens for my phone?**  
Helpful, not mandatory. Stability and light quality deliver 80% of the win. Add clip-on macro only if you know why.

**Q: RAW or JPEG?**  
If your phone supports RAW and you’re comfortable editing, great. If not, nail lighting and exposure in-camera; that’s the bigger lever.

**Q: How close should I get?**  
Close enough for detail without killing light return. If proximity kills sparkle, compensate with a forward kicker or back lights off-axis.

**Q: Can I mix daylight and window light?**  
Yes—if both are daylight. The problem is mixing in warm lamps or greenish tubes. Keep to one family.

**Q: Best way to show clarity?**  
Diffuse to flatten speculars, then tilt light to rake across facets so inclusions reveal without blowing highlights.

**Q: My opal looks dead on camera.**  
Use a wide beam, move the light in slow arcs, and stop when color fires. Lock that position; shoot s
